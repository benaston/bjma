                    <p>Hi there! I'm Ben Aston, and I am a technologist based in London with a passion for the Web and single-page web applications.</p>

                    <p>Examples of my .NET work, <a href="https://github.com/benaston/NState">NState</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benaston/NFeature">NFeature</a> can be found on both <a href="https://github.com/benaston">GitHub</a> and
                        <a href="http://nuget.org/profiles/benaston">NuGet</a>. An implementation in C# of the distributed election "bully" algorithm can be found <a href="https://github.com/benaston/Taskr">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>For JavaScript, my current pet-project <a href="https://github.com/benaston/w">Wizerati</a>, a work-in-progress single-page web application
                        can be found online <a href="http://www.wizerati.com">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>I am available for ad-hoc consultancy &amp; agile coaching. If you'd like to get in touch, my email is ben@bj.ma.</p>

                    <p>Further details on some of the projects I have delivered can be found below.</p>

                    <h1>Wizerati</h1>
                    <p>A search engine for IT contracts and contractors.</p>

                    <p>This application is nothing if not fast and efficient. Superfluous information is absent and
                        the user interface plays only a supporting role to the information the user needs.</p>

                    <p>The spartan homepage embodies this philosophy, having evolved into its present form after user-testing tens of different iterations.
                        The resulting interface relies on stark minimalism for impact rather than flashy logos, effects or complicated features - and its form feels somehow <em>inevitable</em>. Indeed this is my personal definition of a high quality user interface - it "feels inevitable". Watching users operate such an interface is great fun - and is conspicuous by the absence of pauses and questions; users know almost intuitively what to do - but achieving this level of usability takes a great deal of effort.

                    <p>Web applications have a reputation for being more sluggish than their native counterparts. This application attempts to buck that trend. The entire web application - CSS, JavaScript and markup - is
                        delivered in a single compressed HTTP response (or two responses in the currently deployed developmental version for debugging reasons). The application uses a single image (excluding images in search results) - an SVG for the logo - and even this is encoded directly into the page.
                        The result is an application that loads (under optimal network conditions) in under one second - and is significantly quicker to load on high latency networks.

                    <p>
                        Perceived responsiveness can of course, be just as important as the reality. On touch-based devices a "halo" effect is added to confirm the selection of on-screen items,
                        and avoid doubt about button presses. Importantly this also significantly reduces the perceived latency on devices that have unavoidable delays on 'click' events in web applications.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Inside the application, clicking or touching a search result updates the screen much faster than would normally be possible thanks to a combination of client-side caching and the use of DOM element double-buffering. Finally - as far as is possible - changes in position and opacity are controlled using hardware-accelerated CSS3 filters and transforms, providing the best possible chance of a sixty frames-per-second user experience.</p>

                    <p>Somewhat unusual in today's world of JavaScript-heavy single-page web applications, this application had to function without JavaScript and involved some clever tricks to ensure it behaved like a system with more client-side logic.</p>

                    <p>The interface here was built using an HTML5 flex-box layout to guarantee the message field remained in the
                        view-port. URL fragment identifiers were used to ensure the chat history position remained correct when sending messages.</p>
